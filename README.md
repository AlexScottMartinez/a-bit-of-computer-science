## Project: Recursion
### Fibonacci
1. Using iteration, write a method `#fibs` which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of `8`, this function should return the array `[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13]`.
2. Now write another method `#fibs_rec` which solves the same problem, but recursively.
3. Test both versions of your method by passing in various lengths as arguments. To run type `ruby ./recursion.rb` in the terminal to see the results, and to change the inputs by changing the argument of `fib(8)` on line 60 or `fib_rec(8)` on line 62.
### Merge Sort
1. Build a method `#merge_sort` that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology. An input of `[3,2,1,13,8,5,0,1]` should return `[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13]`, and an input `[105,79,100,110]` should return `[79,100,105,110]`.
2. To run type `ruby ./recursion.rb` in the terminal to see the results, and to change the inputs by changing the argument of `merge_sort([3,2,1,13,8,5,0,1])` on line 64.
